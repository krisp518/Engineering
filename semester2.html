            1/19/24 - This week we were taught chemical engineering as well as being introduced to our semester 2 project. Our semester 2 project will be a 6-8 project where I will make an arduino car with my partner Jaiden. For chemical engineering, we just learned about different jobs that fall under the category of chemical engineering, subjects related to chemical engineering like metallurgy or microfluidics, and the moral implications of working in chemical engineering like oil exploration. This weekend I am going to finish homework and study + code.

            1/26/24 - This week we started working on our semester engineering project where my partner deicded we would make an arduino car. My partner is an extremely skilled individual possessing an innate talent for CADing so I hold a lot of faith in our design for the car. I think we are progressing along well as I have almost finished the circuit cad of our arduino while my partner seems to almost be done as well. Next week I plan on finishing the circuit CAD and beginning prototyping our car. I am very excted to see how our prototype and final reflect our cad.
