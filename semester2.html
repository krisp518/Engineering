            1/19/24 - This week we were taught chemical engineering as well as being introduced to our semester 2 project. Our semester 2 project will be a 6-8 project where I will make an arduino car with my partner Jaiden. For chemical engineering, we just learned about different jobs that fall under the category of chemical engineering, subjects related to chemical engineering like metallurgy or microfluidics, and the moral implications of working in chemical engineering like oil exploration. This weekend I am going to finish homework and study + code.

            1/26/24 - This week we started working on our semester engineering project where my partner deicded we would make an arduino car. My partner is an extremely skilled individual possessing an innate talent for CADing so I hold a lot of faith in our design for the car. I think we are progressing along well as I have almost finished the circuit cad of our arduino while my partner seems to almost be done as well. Next week I plan on finishing the circuit CAD and beginning prototyping our car. I am very excted to see how our prototype and final reflect our cad.

            2/5/24 - This week I continued working on the arduino car. My partner began cutting cardboard for the car, setting up the base and aesthetics of the car. I finished CADing my circuit as well as (theoretically) finishing the physical circuit for the arduino. Furthermore, I learned to solder wires for my wheel motors. This week my goal is to finish soldering and fully make sure my circuit for the motors work. By Friday, the wheel motors should fully be completed and I'm hoping to begin the secondary function of our car. This weekend I went shopping with friends and I bought a pair of Doc Martens! FORGOT TO TAKE PICS THIS WEEK :(

            2/13/24 - This week I finished up the driving parts of the car by adding it into the car chasse and rewiring it back in. We had a setback in that the soldered wires broke off and we had to set the motors and breadboard and arduino down. I'm going to now add the non-motor wheels which we made by hot gluing 2 cd discs ono cardboard and a skewer. onto the car and further secure all parts down before I work on the secondary function of the car. My partner will likely now work on the chasse even further.

            2/26/24 - Our car was cube shaped with 2 motor wheels on the front and 2 back wheels made of CDs. It was powered by Arduino and a 9V battery and it performed quite well but less than we had hoped for. We only tested once and that was on the day of performance and it traveled indefinitely. We did, however, have a couple prototypes with the only differences being dimensions and freedom of motion for the wheels. Obviously, the second car did better than the first since our wheel actually turned. I think if we had time we would add a sensor that would cause the car to stop when detecting another object.
