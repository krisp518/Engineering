            <b>8/25/23</b> - I learned about the engineering process as well as safety. For the website, I learned how to add an image to the website, make the heading move using the marquee function, change the background color, and to push to github. We also did a challenge involving pvc pipes and marbles. The goal was to collaborate with teammates to transfer the marble using the pvc pipes and transferring the pipes from one person to another like a chain. We didn't do well in the challenge but we were close. This weekend I'm going to hang out with friends and do homework.

            <b>9/1/23</b> - I learned about the basics of mechanical engineering such as what mechanical engineering entails (Math, Kinematics Thermodynamics and Heat trasfer, material science, structural analysis, etc.) and simple machines (screws, wedges, pulleys, levers, inclines planes, wheel & axles). For this week's challenge, we used TinkerCAD to design various household appliances. The winner got a large kitkat and my friend, Justin Wong, won by designing a PS5. He shared the kitkat with me. I designed a toaster by grabbing a cube, stretching it, and adding holes. This week we designed a rube goldberg machine using simple machines, and we drew out an idea.

            <b> 9/8/23 </b> - My week was busy but it was alright overral. This week in engineering I learned about the history of mechanical engineering (such as how it is the oldest form of engineering) as well as what it entails (such as its sub-elements) and why its steps are important. This week was mostly spent CADing out our simple machine RUbe Goldberg machine with Justing Wong and Jacob Yang. Our RUbe Goldberg machine has 5 simple machines: A screw that leads into a pulley that pulls up a car (wheel and axle), which then rolls down an inclined plane, crashes into a lever and a needle then pops the balloon. I believe the most challenging part will be constructing the screw and constructing the contrapment that will pull down the door which secures the car so that it may roll down the inclined plane.
