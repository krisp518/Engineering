            8/25/23 - I learned about the engineering process as well as safety. For the website, I learned how to add an image to the website, make the heading move using the marquee function, change the background color, and to push to github. We also did a challenge involving pvc pipes and marbles. The goal was to collaborate with teammates to transfer the marble using the pvc pipes and transferring the pipes from one person to another like a chain. We didn't do well in the challenge but we were close. This weekend I'm going to hang out with friends and do homework.
